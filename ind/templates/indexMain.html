            Forest fires pose a serious threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and nearby communities, especially as rising temperatures and dry conditions increase the chances of ignition. These fires can spread rapidly, causing major environmental and economic damage while also impacting air quality and public safety.
            <p>
                To address this growing concern, our project introduces a Forest Fire Prediction System that uses environmental data and machine learning to assess the risk of fire outbreaks. By analyzing key factors such as temperature, humidity, and oxygen levels, the system aims to provide early warnings that support timely preventive action and improved disaster preparedness.
